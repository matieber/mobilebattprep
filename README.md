This is a project that implements an EA-based component for preparing smartphones for a battery-driven test
The project contains java sources of a component which is part of Motrol software-hardware platform that allow to run in-lab battery-driven tests including
profiling, benchmarking and, recently added, distributed inference tests, using smartphone clusters.
The project also contains necesary code to simulate battery charging/discharging actions on different smartphones whose profiles can be found in zipped
folder called device_profile.zip
